# Drum Machine

Drum Machine is the third project for the *Front End Development Libraries* course that is hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
It utilizes the **React** JavaScript library to build the UI. The user can either click the drum pads or press specific
keys to trigger various audio samples.

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp** *Front End Development Libraries Course*. FreeCodeCamp is the provider of the
audio samples for the project. While some ideas have been received from their example project and the instructions have been 
followed, all the components and the style have been made by me, and follow my vision, with both the inspiration and constraints
in mind.
